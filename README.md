  }
}
```

    inputToken {
      id
      symbol

# Development

Adapted from the [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/developer/quick-start)

When using a hosted ethereum data provider, change the following:

  * start block: `startBlock` in `subgraph.yaml` (one month ~172800 blocks)
  * eth data provider, polling interval: `ethereum` and `ethereum_polling_interval` in `docker-compose.yaml`

These changes allow testing with less request/data use.


Start local graph node instance
```
docker-compose up
```

Build and deploy the subgraph locally
```
yarn codegen

yarn create-local

yarn deploy-local
```
